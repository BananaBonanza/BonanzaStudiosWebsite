				<h3> 29 March 2025 4:35PM - Back to Cycling</h3>
				<p> It is spring time here in the northern hemisphere, and that means the days are getting warmer. With the warmth comes my desire to start riding my bike. Now, my current bicycle is not a looker nor a power horse. It is, solely, utilitarian. I bought it from a thrift store last year for, like, 10 dollars. But it functions and can get me from place to place.</p>
				
				<p> For my first ride this spring, I just took a leisurely ride over to a nearby park. It wasn't much, probably only a mile and half both directions, but it was a start! And being able to enjoy the view and sunset is always a joy. Here's to getting back out there this spring and enjoying the weather and the road. My goal for the spring: being able to bike to a nearby ALDIs, buy groceries, and bike back.</p>
