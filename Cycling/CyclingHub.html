						<p> You all thought that I would wait a while, didn't you. Maybe take an extra week to finally make the trip given that I knew I could make it all of the way with my bike ride yesterday. But no! I did it immediately! This morning was a bright and sun-shine filled day and I said to myself, "We're going to do this!" and I did! I've finally done that bike ride and proven to myself that I can actually use my bicycle as a means of transportation and not just for excercise or recreation. This is only the beginning, but it is definitely a great start!</p>

				<h3> 12 April 2025 9:05PM - Testing the Limits</h3>
				<p> It is not lost on me that I am very <i>very</i> out of shape. My body is not cut out for long physical excursions out into the real world. And thus, I need to push past those limits and start seeing what I'm capable of. For some, that's doing an ultra-marathon and testing the extent of human capability. For me, that's riding a bike for four and a half miles.</>
				<center> 
					<img src="secondRide.jpg" alt="My bicycle with a water drainage canal in the background."></br>
					Going the next steps toward being able to bike for real.
				</center>
				<p> Now, the reason for the four an a half miles being a good number is because that is, approximately, the distance to my local ALDIs and back. If I can successfully bike that distance without a cargo, then that is the first step to being able to bike that distance <i>with</i> cargo! The plan's coming together!</p>

				<h3> 29 March 2025 4:35PM - Back to Cycling</h3>
				<p> It is spring time here in the northern hemisphere, and that means the days are getting warmer. With the warmth comes my desire to start riding my bike. Now, my current bicycle is not a looker nor a power horse. It is, solely, utilitarian. I bought it from a thrift store last year for, like, 10 dollars. But it functions and can get me from place to place.</p>
				
				<p> For my first ride this spring, I just took a leisurely ride over to a nearby park. It wasn't much, probably only a mile and half both directions, but it was a start! And being able to enjoy the view and sunset is always a joy. Here's to getting back out there this spring and enjoying the weather and the road. My goal for the spring: being able to bike to a nearby ALDIs, buy groceries, and bike back.</p>
