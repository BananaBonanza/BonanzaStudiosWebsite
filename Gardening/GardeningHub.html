			<h3>17 March 2025 8:23PM - Seed Sprouts</h3>
			<p> With this being the first spring in our new house, one of the things my spouse and I have always wanted to do is to start growing our own garden. Well we've started!</p>
			<center> 
				<img src="seedlings_2025-03-17.jpg" alt="Sprouting Seedlings in a window with six signs that show which seedling is which type of plant."></br>
				Our first set of seedlings still in the window!
			</center>
			<p> At present, we haven't started nearly enough seedlings and I do fear that we may be missing our opportunity to get a sizeable harvest. But, with this being our first year, I'd be glad to get a single <i>leaf</i> of lettucs, let alone an actual harvest. The current plants we have planned will be planted in a four-by-four square foot garden as follows:</p>

				The initial setup for our square foot garden.
			</center>
			<p> The labels are 'Lt' for lettuce, 'To' for tomatos, and 'SB' for string beans. I'm planning on going to the hardware store tomorrow to get the last things we need to actually set up the planting bed. Expect more soon!</p>
