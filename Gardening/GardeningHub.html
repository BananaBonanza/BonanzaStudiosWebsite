				<h3> 23 March 2025 10:22AM - First Planter Box</h3>
				<p> After a trip to the hardware store and one last night where the temperature got below 0Â°C, the garden beds have finally been created and put in the ground! The four-by-four bed was made from one 16 foot piece of wood that was sawed into 4 foot lengths. </p>

				<p>Humorouously, one of our cats made the decision after making the planter box, that it was time to transplant the seedlings. She did this by knocking the seedling planter off of the shelf it was sitting on and having dirt and seed alike fall on the carpeted floor. I can take a hint. Thus, the seedlings from the last post have been transplanted in the new box!</p>

				<p> I did not quite follow the last blog post in how I planted all of the plants. The lettuce did indeed go in the back, but the tomatos and green beans are in different spots. Regardless, I now am looking forward to seeing if these little plants are going to be able to grow outside! I don't have high hopes for some of the less-hardy plants (looking at you tomatos), but the lettuce and green beans will hopefully do well.</p>

				<h3>17 March 2025 8:23PM - Seed Sprouts</h3>
				<p> With this being the first spring in our new house, one of the things my spouse and I have always wanted to do is to start growing our own garden. Well we've started!</p>
				<center> 
					<img src="seedlings_2025-03-17.jpg" alt="Sprouting Seedlings in a window with six signs that show which seedling is which type of plant."></br>
					Our first set of seedlings still in the window!
				</center>
				<p> At present, we haven't started nearly enough seedlings and I do fear that we may be missing our opportunity to get a sizeable harvest. But, with this being our first year, I'd be glad to get a single <i>leaf</i> of lettucs, let alone an actual harvest. The current plants we have planned will be planted in a four-by-four square foot garden as follows:</p>

					<img src="gardenPlot_1-1.jpg" alt="A four-by-four grid representing the square foot garden. The top row has the label L T, the second row has the label T O, and the third row only has the first cell filled in with S B."></br>
					The initial setup for our square foot garden.
				</center>
				<p> The labels are 'Lt' for lettuce, 'To' for tomatos, and 'SB' for string beans. I'm planning on going to the hardware store tomorrow to get the last things we need to actually set up the planting bed. Expect more soon!</p>
