			<h3>16 March 2025 10:49 AM - Comic Expo Plans</h3>
			<p> As some of you may know, I have been a volunteer at a nearby comic book expo over the last few years. With it being a small-ish convention, it is far easier to get table space to run some of the weird games that I want to try out without having to convince my friends to take a Friday out of their busy schedules to play. This year is no different and I am planning on running several games. Here is the list I have at present:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Apollo: NASA Moon Missions. A board game centered around simulating the Gemini and Apollo missions to space and the moon.</li>
				<li> Cairn. Specifically, I have submitted to host two Game Master (GM) workshops teaching people how to run a tabletop role playing game. These workshops will have the 'players' create their own adventure and they even get to keep the rules pamphlet at the end!</li>
				<li> Skate Wizards. For Hunnukah this last year, I molded several of the default adventures in the Skate Wizards rule book into one short excursion for my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. I'm further adapting that into a 1-hour game where you have to use magic and your skating skills to shred the gnar and save the dwarvish clans from ruin.</li>
				<li> Dungeons and Dragons Tournament. I've put my name into the list of dungeon masters for this year's tournament. I may not get selected, but if I do, then I will be running one of the tables for the competive adventure Kerry sets up every year.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The specific dates and times for each of these is still to be determined. And, indeed, I may also add to this list (I'm thinking of also running a Call of Cthulhu game again). But for now, that's the plan. Hope to see various folks there!</p>
