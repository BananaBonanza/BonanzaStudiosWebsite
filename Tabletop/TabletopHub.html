				<h3>10 May 2025 9:35 AM - Convention Recap</h3>
				<p> For all of you who came out to the convention, thank you for a great weekend! I personally had a blast being able to play games with everyone and enjoy the love of table top and board games with everyone. And to those few of you who attended the Game Master workshop, thank you! It was a great turn out and I'm glad everyone enjoyed being able to make an adventure. For anyone who missed out, feel free to reach out and you may be able to convince me to run it again for some pizza or something!</p>

				<p> One particularly fun story was on the very last day. I was running the Apollo board game for some folks in the last hour of the convention. They were holding on by the figurative skin of their teeth! Barely making the rolls to do the orbital maneuvers and had just completed the first of three experiments when they landed on the moon! At that point, 15 minutes was called (as the time left for the convention) and they said "Nope, we're out, we made it to the moon and that's good enough!" Which, in their defense, they were the first table to make it there so they were right to end it.</p>

				<p> I will say one thing that wasn't so good about the convention. There was apparently a situation at a table on Saturday where the game master was talked down to and completely disrespected. I don't know the full details, but they had to leave because of how bad it was. Suffice to say, when that person didn't show up to the Call of Cthulhu game that I was going to play at, I did it instead! So, my note from my blog post in March turned out to happen - I DID run a game of Call of Cthulhu. Maybe next year I'll just sign up to do it rather than require something bad to happen first.<p>

				<h3>16 March 2025 10:49 AM - Local Expo Plans</h3>
				<p> As some of you may know, I have been a volunteer at a nearby comic book expo over the last few years. With it being a small-ish convention, it is far easier to get table space to run some of the weird games that I want to try out without having to convince my friends to take a Friday out of their busy schedules to play. This year is no different and I am planning on running several games. Here is the list I have at present:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Apollo: NASA Moon Missions. A board game centered around simulating the Gemini and Apollo missions to space and the moon.</li>
					<li> Cairn. Specifically, I have submitted to host two Game Master (GM) workshops teaching people how to run a tabletop role playing game. These workshops will have the 'players' create their own adventure and they even get to keep the rules pamphlet at the end!</li>
					<li> Skate Wizards. For Hunnukah this last year, I molded several of the default adventures in the Skate Wizards rule book into one short excursion for my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. I'm further adapting that into a 1-hour game where you have to use magic and your skating skills to shred the gnar and save the dwarvish clans from ruin.</li>
					<li> Dungeons and Dragons Tournament. I've put my name into the list of dungeon masters for this year's tournament. I may not get selected, but if I do, then I will be running one of the tables for the competive adventure Kerry sets up every year.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> The specific dates and times for each of these is still to be determined. And, indeed, I may also add to this list (I'm thinking of also running a Call of Cthulhu game again). But for now, that's the plan. Hope to see you all there!</p>
