			<h3>17 March 2025 8:23PM - Seed Sprouts</h3>
			<p> With this being the first spring in our new house, one of the things my spouse and I have always wanted to do is to start growing our own garden. Well we've started!</p>
			<center> 
				<img src="Gardening/seedlings_2025-03-17.jpg" alt="Sprouting Seedlings in a window with six signs that show which seedling is which type of plant."></br>
				Our first set of seedlings still in the window!
			</center>
			<p> At present, we haven't started nearly enough seedlings and I do fear that we may be missing our opportunity to get a sizeable harvest. But, with this being our first year, I'd be glad to get a single <i>leaf</i> of lettucs, let alone an actual harvest. The current plants we have planned will be planted in a four-by-four square foot garden as follows:</p>

				The initial setup for our square foot garden.
			</center>
			<p> The labels are 'Lt' for lettuce, 'To' for tomatos, and 'SB' for string beans. I'm planning on going to the hardware store tomorrow to get the last things we need to actually set up the planting bed. Expect more soon!</p>

			<h3>16 March 2025 10:49 AM - Local Comic Expo Plans</h3>
			<p> As some of you may know, I have been a volunteer at the Huntsville Alabama comic book expo over the last few years. With it being a small-ish convention, it is far easier to get table space to run some of the weird games that I want to try out without having to convince my friends to take a Friday out of their busy schedules to play. This year is no different and I am planning on running several games. Here is the list I have at present:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Apollo: NASA Moon Missions. A board game centered around simulating the Gemini and Apollo missions to space and the moon.</li>
				<li> Cairn. Specifically, I have submitted to host two Game Master (GM) workshops teaching people how to run a tabletop role playing game. These workshops will have the 'players' create their own adventure and they even get to keep the rules pamphlet at the end!</li>
				<li> Skate Wizards. For Hunnukah this last year, I molded several of the default adventures in the Skate Wizards rule book into one short excursion for my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. I'm further adapting that into a 1-hour game where you have to use magic and your skating skills to shred the gnar and save the dwarvish clans from ruin.</li>
				<li> Dungeons and Dragons Tournament. I've put my name into the list of dungeon masters for this year's tournament. I may not get selected, but if I do, then I will be running one of the tables for the competive adventure Kerry sets up every year.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The specific dates and times for each of these is still to be determined. And, indeed, I may also add to this list (I'm thinking of also running a Call of Cthulhu game again). But for now, that's the plan. Hope to see you all there from April 25-27!</p>
